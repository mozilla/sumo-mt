Refresh Firefox - reset add-ons and settings
[[Template:desktoponly]]

If you're having problems with Firefox, refreshing it can help. The refresh feature fixes many issues by restoring Firefox to its default state while saving your essential information like bookmarks, passwords, and open tabs. {note}'''Important:''' Since Firefox will revert to its original state, your own configurations and customizations, including [[Find and install add-ons to add features to Firefox#w_what-types-of-add-ons-can-i-install|extensions]], extension data, and about:config [[Configuration Editor for Firefox|preference configurations]]  are removed. If you've made accessibility configurations, you may need to change them back after refreshing.{/note}

= What does the refresh feature do? =
All of your Firefox settings and personal information are stored in a [[Profiles - Where Firefox stores your bookmarks, passwords and other user data|profile folder]]. The refresh feature works by creating a new profile folder for you while saving your important data.

Add-ons which are normally stored inside the Firefox profile folder, such as [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/ extensions] and [[Use themes to change the look of Firefox|themes]], will be removed. Add-ons stored in other locations{for not fx53}, such as [[Use plugins to play audio, video, games and more |plugins]],{/for} will not be removed but any modified preferences{for not fx53} (such as plugins you have disabled){/for} will be reset.
