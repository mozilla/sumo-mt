Content blocking


{for not fx63}[[T:update fx desktop]]{/for}
{for fx67}
Content blocking is a collection of Firefox privacy features that protect you from threats and annoyances on the Web. This includes protections against trackers, which collect your browsing data across multiple websites. Starting with Firefox version 67, you can block harmful scripts including cryptominers and fingerprinters.

In some cases, blocking this content makes pages load faster, but can affect the page's functionality. It’s easy to [[#w_turn-content-blocking-off-on-individual-sites|disable blocking on sites you trust]]. You can also customize your content blocking preferences to [[#w_how-to-block-more-or-fewer-trackers|block more or fewer trackers]].

Some websites use trackers that can monitor your activity across the Internet. Content blocking is a collection of Firefox settings that block many of these third-party trackers. It keeps your browsing more private so information about you won’t be invisibly tracked, stored, and shared between websites.

In some cases, blocking trackers keeps parts of pages or entire pages from loading. It’s easy to [[#w_turn-content-blocking-off-on-individual-sites_2|disable blocking on sites you trust]]. You can also customize your content blocking preferences to [[#w_how-to-block-more-or-fewer-trackers_2|block more or fewer trackers]].

Content blocking is a collection of Firefox settings, allowing you to block content that affects privacy and browsing performance. Starting with [[Find what version of Firefox you are using|Firefox version]] 63, you can block third-party tracking cookies and all detected trackers (previously known as Tracking Protection).

=Privacy protections included in content blocking=
*Trackers: Tracking generally refers to content, cookies, or scripts that can collect your browsing data across multiple sites. Firefox blocks trackers in private windows by default. Select the '''Strict''' or '''Custom''' radio button for stronger tracking protections. 
*Third-party tracking cookies: Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. Block third-party tracking cookies using the '''Strict''' and '''Custom''' radio buttons in Firefox version 67. 
*Cryptominers: Cryptomining scripts use your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) to invisibly mine cryptocurrency. These scripts slow down your computer and drain your battery. Block cryptominers using the '''Custom''' radio button in Firefox version 67. 
*Fingerprinters: Fingerprinting scripts are invisibly embedded on many web pages, harvesting a snapshot of your computer’s configuration to build a digital fingerprint that can be used to track you across the web even if you clear your cookies. Fingerprinting violates Firefox’s anti-tracking policy. Block fingerprinters using the '''Custom''' radio button in Firefox version 67. 

=How to block more or fewer trackers=
By default, Firefox protects you from being tracked in [[Private Browsing - Use Firefox without saving history|private windows]] using a basic list of known trackers provided by [https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection Disconnect]. Firefox allows some trackers so websites can function properly. You can change your settings  to block trackers all the time, to block trackers from Disconnect’s strict list, or to not block any trackers at all. 

To adjust your settings:
#Click the menu button [[Image:fx57menu]].
#Click {menu Content Blocking}. <br />This takes you to the ''Content Blocking'' section in your Firefox [[T:optionsorpreferences]] Privacy & Security panel.
#;[[Image:Content Blocking]]
#Choose your content blocking settings:
*'''Standard''': Only blocks known trackers in private windows. This is the default setting. To restore to defaults at anytime, select '''Standard'''.
*'''Strict''': Blocks trackers in all windows and third-party tracking [[Cookies - Information that websites store on your computer|cookies]].
*'''Custom''': Lets you choose what to block. You can also turn off all content blocking using the '''Custom''' radio button.

You can also set Firefox to always send websites a ''Do Not Track'' signal. See [[How do I turn on the Do Not Track feature?]] to learn more.

=How to detect when content blocking is on=
When Firefox is blocking content on a website, a shield icon [[Image:Address bar shield]] will appear in your address bar.
;[[Image:url shield 65]]
[[Template:controlcenterpanel]] View the Content Blocking section. This provides more information about the type of content Firefox is blocking, such as detected trackers and trackers set by third-party tracking cookies.
;[[Image:content blocking panel 65]]
The content that is blocked will depend on the website and your settings. Click on the arrows "'''>'''" to the right of the ''Trackers'' and ''Cookies'' settings to see what content has been blocked or permitted on the specific site you're on.
;[[Image:blocked cookies 65]]
Blocked content will be labeled as ''Blocked'' and grayed out.

=Turn content blocking off on individual sites=
Sometimes content blocking can prevent pages or parts of pages from loading. If content blocking interferes with your browsing, you can disable it on individual sites. The shield icon appears in the address bar when Firefox is actively blocking content on a page.
#[[Template:controlcenterpanel]]
#;[[Image:content blocking panel 65]]
#Click the {button Turn off Blocking for This Site} button from a normal browsing window to disable blocking for the website. <br />If you're in a private window, click the {button Turn off Blocking Temporarily} button (see below). <br />Once content blocking is disabled, a shield icon with a strikethrough [[Image:shield icon strikethrough]] will appear in your address bar. To turn content blocking back on, expand the Control Center panel by clicking the shield or the {button site information} button [[Image:site info icon]] and click the {button Turn on Blocking for This Site} button.

=Content Blocking in Private Browsing=
Since [[Private Browsing - Use Firefox without saving history|Private Browsing]] doesn’t save information about your browsing session, when you disable content blocking for a site, it will only remain disabled during your current private browsing session. When you start a new private browsing session, your content blocking settings will be restored for all sites. If you’ve disabled content blocking for a site while in a normal browsing window, Firefox will continue to disable content blocking for this same site when in a private window.

=Block lists in Firefox=
By default, Firefox uses the [https://disconnect.me Disconnect.me] Level 1 block list. For more aggressive tracking protection, use the Disconnect<!-- -->.me Level 2 block list.
*Level 1 blocks commonly known analytics trackers, social sharing trackers, and advertising trackers. However, the basic protection list allows some known content trackers so that fewer pages break or fail to load.
*Level 2 list blocks all known trackers, including analytics trackers, social sharing trackers, and advertising trackers as well as content trackers. The strict list will break some videos, photo slideshows, and social networking features.

==Change your block list==
#Click the menu button [[Image:fx57menu]].
#Click {menu Content Blocking}. <br />This takes you to the ''Content Blocking'' section in your Firefox [[T:optionsorpreferences]] Privacy & Security panel.
#Select the '''Custom''' radio button.
#Click the '''Change block list''' link.
#Choose the block list you want to use.
