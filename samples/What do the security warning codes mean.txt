What do the security warning codes mean?
When Firefox connects to a secure website (the URL begins with "http'''s'''://"), it must verify that the certificate presented by the website is valid and that the encryption is strong enough to adequately protect your privacy. If it is unable to verify this, Firefox stops connecting to the site and will show you an error page with the message, {for not fx66}''Your connection is not secure''{/for}{for fx66}''Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead''{/for}.

{for not fx66}[[Image:Fx52InsecureConnection]]{/for}{for fx66}[[Image:Fx66Warning-SecurityRisk]]{/for}

Click the {button Advanced} button to view the error code and other information about the error. Common errors are described in this article.

* If Firefox shows you a ''Secure Connection Failed'' {for fx66}or ''Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue''{/for} error page instead, see [[Troubleshoot the "Secure Connection Failed" error message|this article]].

=What to do if you see these errors?=
If you see a ''Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead'' message, you may:
*Contact the website owner and ask them to correct their certificate.
*Click {button Go Back (Recommended)}, or visit a different website.
*If you are on a corporate network or using antivirus software, reach out to the support teams for assistance.
After viewing the error code and other information about the error, click the {button Accept the Risk and Continue} button to load the site at your own risk.  This will add a security exception for the website certificate.

{warning}'''Warning!''' Do not proceed to the website unless you understand the reasons for the security warning. Legitimate public sites will '''not''' require you to add a security exception for their certificate. An invalid certificate can be an indication of a web page that will defraud you or steal your identity.{/warning}

=MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR _ADDITIONAL_POLICY_CONSTRAINT_FAILED=

This error indicates that the website's certificate has not complied with security policies in [https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA Mozilla's CA Certificate Program]. Most browsers, not just Firefox, do not trust certificates by GeoTrust, RapidSSL, Symantec, Thawte, and VeriSign because these certificate authorities failed to follow security practices in the past. 

The owners of the website need to work with their certificate authority to correct the policy problem. Mozilla's CA Certificate Program publishes a list of [https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Upcoming_Distrust_Actions upcoming policy actions affecting certificate authorities] which contains details that might be useful to the website owners.

=ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT=
The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.

Self-signed certificates make your data safe from eavesdroppers, but say nothing about who the recipient of the data is. This is common for intranet websites that aren't available publicly and you may bypass the warning for such sites. More details are available in the support article [[How to troubleshoot security error codes on secure websites]].

=SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN=
Firefox does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for that particular site. Information sent over this site could be at risk, so the best thing for you to do is contact the website owners to correct the problem.

=SEC_ERROR_OCSP_INVALID_SIGNING_CERT=
The site is not configured correctly and failed a security check. If you visit this site, attackers could try to steal your private information, like passwords, emails, or credit card details.

The issue is with the website, and there is nothing you can do to resolve it. You can notify the websiteâ€™s administrator about the problem.

You may also see certificate error messages when the file in your profile folder that stores your certificates {filepath cert9.db} has become corrupted. Try to delete this file while Firefox is closed to regenerate it:

= What to do if you see this error? =
If you encounter a "Your connection is not secure" error, you should contact the owners of the website, if possible, and inform them of the error. It is recommended that you wait for the website to be fixed before using it. The safest thing to do is to click {button Go Back}, or to visit a different website. Unless you know and understand the technical reason why the website presented incorrect identification, and are willing to risk communicating over a connection that could be vulnerable to an eavesdropper, you should not proceed to the website.

== The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed ==
{note}The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.
<br><br>Error code: ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT{/note} 

Self-signed certificates make your data safe from eavesdroppers, but say nothing about who the recipient of the data is. This is common for intranet websites that aren't available publicly and you may bypass the warning for such sites. More details are available in the support article [[How to troubleshoot security error codes on secure websites]].

== The certificate is only valid for ''(site name)'' ==
{note}example.<i></i>com uses an invalid security certificate.<br><br>The certificate is only valid for the following names: www.example.<i></i>com, *.example.<i></i>com
<br><br>Error code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN{/note}

This error is telling you that the identification sent to you by the site is actually for another site. While anything you send would be safe from eavesdroppers, the recipient may not be who you think it is.

A common situation is when the certificate is actually for a different part of the same site. For example, you may have visited https://example<!---->.com, but the certificate is for https://'''www.'''example<!---->.com. In this case, if you access https://'''www.'''example<!---->.com directly, you should not receive the warning.

== Corrupted certificate store == 
You may also see certificate error messages when the file in your profile folder that stores your certificates ({for not fx58}{filepath cert8.db}{/for}{for fx58}{filepath cert9.db}{/for}) has become corrupted. Try to delete this file while Firefox is closed to regenerate it:
{note}'''Note:''' You should only perform these steps as a last resort, after all other troubleshooting steps have failed.{/note}

#[[T:closeFirefox]]
# Click on the file named {for not fx58}{filepath cert8.db}{/for}{for fx58}{filepath cert9.db}{/for}.

;{note}'''Note:''' {for not fx58}{filepath cert8.db}{/for}{for fx58}{filepath cert9.db}{/for} will be recreated when you restart Firefox. This is normal.{/note}

= Bypassing the warning =
{note}'''Note:''' Some security warnings cannot be bypassed.{/note}
You should only bypass the warning if you're confident in both the identity of the website and the integrity of your connection - even if you trust the site, someone could be tampering with your connection. Data you enter into a site over a weakly encrypted connection can be vulnerable to eavesdroppers as well.

In order to bypass the warning page, click {button Advanced}:
* On sites with a weak encryption you will then be shown an option to load the site using outdated security.
* On sites where the certificate cannot be validated, you might be given the option to add an exception.

{warning}Legitimate public sites will '''not''' ask you to add an exception for their certificate - in this case an invalid certificate can be an indication of a web page that will defraud you or steal your identity.{/warning}
